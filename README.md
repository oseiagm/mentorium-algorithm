The bidirectional, score-based round-robin pairing algorithm that powers Mentorium, the academic mentorship management platform.


Features

- Per-mentor statistics (count, average, highest, lowest CWA)

Quick start
-----------
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# open http://localhost:3000
```

How it works
------------
- Students are sorted by CWA descending.
- Allocation passes alternate forward and backward across mentors to balance strengths.
- Stats are computed per mentor for a quick quality view.
